# Memo - [Accepted] WWDC23 Swift Student Challenge Submission

## About the project
How many times did you enter a room and instantly forget what you were there for? In this experience, Babbly's here to talk to you about short-term memory and working memory. Through quick challenges with colorful and animated little monsters, Memo will change your perspective on how your mind truly works. You will learn the difference between the types of memory, and how you use them in your day by day.

### Credits

Memo is based on classes that my grandmother gives to elderly women here in Recife, called “Memory Workshop”. There, she does dynamics on how to improve memory and work on it so you don't lose what's most precious. Thanks for the inspiration, vovis!

The TED Talk that most motivated me to work on this theme was “How your working memory makes sense of the world”, by Peter Doolittle.

## Design

To bring Memo to life, I first thought of little monsters (inspired by Pixar's Inside Out movie), and they are all very colorful so that I could create an environment where your mind would reeeally be put to work. A friend of mine gave the idea of having the background at a museum, so with that in mind I created different museums as the game goes deeper in your core memory. Everything in Memo was drawn by me, including the handmade letterings.

## Development & Frameworks

I used SwiftUI to code all of the project, except the pop to root view controller method in which I explored a functionality from UIKit. To play the soundtrack, I used Foundation and AVFoundation.

## Gameplay

## How to play?

Soon to be on App Store, but to play you can download the project and open it on Xcode or Playgrounds. Then, click on the play button and have fun testing your memory! :)
